# Blog 3 Notes and Brainstorm

Blog 3 Prompt
Of the three ethical theories we have studied in this course, which do you think
is the most plausible?  Using specific elements of the theory, explain why this is the case.

What is the biggest weakness with the theory you have identified?  How should the
theory be modified to make it even more plausible?  In providing a fix,
make sure you do not alter the essential nature of the theory
(i.e. do not fix it by transforming it into one of the other theories we have studied).
