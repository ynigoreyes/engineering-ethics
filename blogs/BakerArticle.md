# Notes

### Purpose
* There are debates about whether Ethics should actually be taught. Are they teaching the right truths?
Is what they are teaching right or wrong? Who has the balls to really say that what they say is gospel?
* There is also the situation that some teachers are not comfortable teaching something that does not have
a solid "yes" or "no" answer

### Basic Concepts - The History Of Engineering
* Dates back to 2000 BC depending on what you considered engineering.
  People back then created canals, irrigation systems and other structures
  to help them survive. **Why** did they create it? To survive!
* Formal Engineering education began because of the <mark>rapid growth of the American West</mark>.
  This forced America to build schools for engineering to counter the shortage of engineers at this time.
* All the engineering societies had <mark>a different set of goals, a thread of commonalty running thorugh them</mark> (page 2).
    * insuring professional performance
    * professional recognition

### Moral Reasoning and Dilemmas - Why we are learning this
* Teaching of Ethics <-> Development of Moral Behavior
* Tools for evaluating moral consequences are ...
    * Concepts
    * Rules
    * Principles
* We have to remember that the individual has free will and
  that they are responsible for their own actions
* There are many times where there are no true right or wrongs. That is where philosophy comes
  into play. Philosophy helps us go in the right direction in terms of finding a proper answer.
  Without it, the answers generated are kind of all over the place

### Standards and Law
* Not everything can be tested/controlled
* Change is inevitable, control is in the air
* We also need to ask who is in control/is responsible for all the changes
* Engineers also become witnesses at some point to determine ethics aswell
* There is a lot that goes into making sure that witnesses are actually good
    * They loose credibility if they slant an argument
    * A background check is taken
    * They must be considered an expert(someone who has more experience than most)

### Concern for Safety and Risk
* **Big Ideas to remember**
    * Risk Assessment
    * Cost/Benifit Analysis
* Have to be careful not to value some people more than others. But that is in debate right now
* What exactly is marginal theory???
* The correct decision is not always clear. For the most part, an ethical decision is just choosing
  the most ethical out of the options given to you, which does not specifically mean that decision is ethical.
  **TL;DR choosing the lesser of evils is a valid choice and thought process**
* You must take into account that there are people who consider different things facts due to their age,
  gender or anything really
* Values and facts are inseperable. People will base their values on facts
* Risk assessment is also a factor of who assigns a change. People will be more willing to put themselves
  in danger rather than having someone else put them in that situation. (example: skydiving)
* **"judging acceptability"** checking to see if everyone else agrees with your though process
### Responsibilities and Employer Authority
* There are four different responsibilites for engineers
    1. role responsibility
    2. casual responsibility
    3. liability responsibility
    3. capacity responsibility
* Corporations are do not have morals, the engineers themselves do
* **What sets apart the engineers from the coporation is moral responsibility**

* **Politics vs. Ethics**
    * Union Politics - basically necessitate double-talk
    * Professional Ethics - complete honesty
* Ethics are not fixed, they are situational
* All right, wrong and morals go out the window when planning ends and operation begins. If
  people fought all the time, there would be no management

### Moral Obligations and Rights of Professionals
* Engineers should have the right to
    1. Act according to their ethical beliefs and decline working against project that contradtict them
    2. Say what they need to say, given that they do not spill the secrets
    3. Not be a scapegoat that gets blamed for shit they cannot control
    4. Self-improvement
    5. Get into politics outside of work
    6. Apply for better jobs
    7. To fight against unjust penalties towards them
    8. Appeal for ethical review
    9. Privacy
* Employee vs. professional rights - professional conscience is important
* Whistle Blowing - calling out management when they are doing wrong
    * LOTS of risk, career wise and financially. A lot of people lose their job because of this
### Ethical Theory
* Intuitions does not equal ethical theory
* Intuitions is a judgement
* Is there a limit to rationality??? If so, that means that intuition IS reliable

**Arguments against reliablility**
1. Historical - Reflective
2. Psychological

**Arguments for reliability**

*D. Sosa*
1. Introspection perception
    * taking a look around you and how the world is at the moment
2. Intuition
    * Just because some intuition is "wrong", does not mean it always is
