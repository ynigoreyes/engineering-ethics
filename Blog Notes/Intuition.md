# Intuition

### What is intuition
* Feeling like something is just right... **WITHOUT** emotion
* When you try to mix intuition with emotion, it no longer becomes intuition

### Questioning the Reliability of Intuition
* Sometimes people's intuitions should be questions. Some people really believe they are
  doing the right thing, like Hitler. Or the treatment of Native Americans or slaves in the States
* Intuitions can change over time
* Given some condition/environment, how can someone know that thier intuition is not based on it.
  Is their intuition still reliable?

### Defending the Reliability of Intuitions
* Compare intuition with perception. We do not reject perception just because we did not correctly see
  one situation correctly. Nor do we reject vision just because someone is color blind

### A Quantifies Place for Intuitions
* There is a time and place to use intuition
* Throwing out intuition based on doubts seems too drastic
* We want to determine an environment where you can and/or cannot use intuition
* Scenarios
    1. A person is super emotional. May not be the best time to use intuition
    2. Intuition based on basic ideas >>> intuition based on complex ideas
    3. Time of when intuitions rise should not be taken into account
