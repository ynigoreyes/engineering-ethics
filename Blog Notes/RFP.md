# Lecture - 4: Respect for Persons
*Detontological/icantian ethics*

### Meritorious vs. Intrinsic
* Meritorious
  * Based on what is done
  * Recognized
* Intrinsic
  * Based on Immutable Characteristics
    * Consciousness - Self-Awareness
    * Identity - People that look like me
    * Rationality and Autonomy
    * Sentience - Capacity to feel pleasure or pain
    * Soul
  * Some people still require some sort of respect

### Article Notes
* Meritorious and Intrinsic Respect

#### 1. What is the supreme principle of morality?
* Catigorical Imperative
* Kant wants people to not treat people like shit and treat them
  better than just a person in that profession
* Souls == created in God's image (Page 34)
* Kant believes that people should be respected since they are rational and
  autonomous beings (Page 34)
* If you are not either of those, you are not respected (Page 34)
* You CANT do stuff that will challenge someone else's rationality and autunomy

#### 2. How should we solve moral problems?
* There is this whole processes... Check lecture 6
* Perfect Dutys - duties that everyone should should follow
* Imperfect Dutys - duties that some people are not required to follow
* There are more things to consider than just the consequences. The amount of people,
  or the scope of the situation matters
* Any solutions to a problem that were proposed that are not universalized and
  rationally accepted are discarded (Page 36)

#### 3. What kind of persons should we be?
* We should do the right thing because it is the right thing to do
* *Moral Fortitude* - Doing the right thing even when people tell you not to
* REMEMBER virtue is a character trait that is good
* The ultimate test for morality is based on the action in question and NOT on the traits (Page 37)

#### Criticism and Responses
* A soul is not universaly accepted and is questionable as a basis for ethics; What has a sould???? (Page 37)
    * Animals?
    * Unborn Babies?
* What about people with disabilities and are not "rational and autonomous"; Technically don't need to be respected
* Maybe sentiment could work? AKA if something can experience pleasure/pain
* **The Hospital Scene** (Page 38)
    * The guy does not want to leave because of history
    * The engineer wants to buy him out
    * The engineer is actually not acting ethically in terms of RFP
        * The guy is thinking rationally and is autonomous, meaning he deserves respect
        * RFP focuses on the well-being of individuals, not specifically society as as whole,
          that would be utilitarianism
    * *Starting Page 39*
    * People don't get RFP/Kant's stuff because if does not have anything to really do
      with the outcome of the actions
    * How big is a "substantial" good? Who gets to pick and choose whether or not the good
      is truly greater than the bad

#### Take Home Lessons
* People should not be just a means to an end
* Respect comes from people...
    * having a soul
    * being rational and autonomous
    * havind sentinence
* Not based on consequences of actions
