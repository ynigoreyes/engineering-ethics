# Five Things We Need to Know About Technology

*Author: Neil Postman*
This author seems to really like to talk about the affects of technology on religion.
He does not think they go very well together...
He is probably a religious advocate

## Intro
> Henry David Thoreau
>
> "All our inventions are but improved means to an unimproved end"

The author beliefs expose us. Basically saying that we believe that everything new
makes the old irrelevant
> "The human dilemma is as it has always been, and it is a delusion to
> believe that the technological changes of our era have rendered irrelevant the wisdom of the ages and the
> sages."

# First Idea

> "...all technological change is a trade-off"

There is always something found and something lost that we need to take into consideration

This is usually not seen since a lot of people only advertise the good stuff

Questions to ask oneself when looking at a new technology
1. What does the new tech do?
2. What does it undo?

Basically, you do not know what you are talking about until you understand both sides of the story

> "Idea Number One, then, is that culture always pays a price for technology."

# Second Idea

> "...new technologies are never distributed evenly among the population"

**Not everyone is affected the same way by new technologies**

Theres a situation where the creation of a technology makes things easier and better for a certain group of
people and then forces them to move away from old technology. Well what about others that depended on that
old technology? What will happen to them? They will die since that technology is considered obsolete.

Questions to ask oneself when looking at a new technology
1. Who will be affected by this new tech? In a good way?
2. What kind of industry will be favored?

There is a big problem with computers taking over...
* A lot of trade work has not become a number. Everything a person does is based on the quality of their work.
* Those in trade work have way more competition now that everything is available online

#### Biggest Problem with computers
Society has taught us to believe that all the problems are a result of not having enough information, when really
the problem is just masked by it. The big problem is that we do not know **where** the problem came to be. We just
assume that is because we do not have enough information

# Third Idea
> "...Embedded in every technology there is a powerful idea, sometimes two or three powerful
> ideas. These ideas are often hidden from our view because they are of a somewhat abstract nature. But this
> should not be taken to mean that they do not have practical consequences"

There are hidden ideas with everything that we create. Sometimes, they aren't so good...

Technology comes with its own philosophy. It determines how people think and what people value. It will change
what people value. It may go from carefulness to speed. Immediacy instead of history.

# Fouth Idea
> "...Technological change is not additive; it is ecological."

Technology changes EVERYTHING, it does not add to what was there before. It will REPLACE what was there before.

Like all the really big important people "*obliterated the 19th century, and created the 20th*" Once they had created
something new and awesome, the whole culture changed and the past was not the past. Capitalist are dangerous because they
have no regard for what will happen to the old technology

#### Great Example: SATs and Standardized testing
* Learning has never been the same, now everything is a test score
* TV has made politics into a game of who can say the best thing to make people feel good about them in 30 seconds

# Fifth Idea
> "...a common tendency to think of our technological creations as if they were God-given"

We start to take all of the new technology for granted. We think that it was always like this.
We then start to leave the technology as it is. We don't try to improve it or modify it. We accept
it for its flaws, when we should be trying to fix them.

# Conclusion

**Don't let technology use you!**
