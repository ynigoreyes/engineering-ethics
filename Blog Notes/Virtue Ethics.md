# Lecture 6 - Intrisic Respect

* Who/What a person is
* Tells us who/what category imperative applies to
* Tells us who CI implies to

* `intrinsic` - Naturally belonging to; essential
* `respect` - Being nice and thoughtful

* **Catigorical Imperative** - How do we choose who to respect naturally
  * Principle of Humanity
    * Rationality & Autonomy - lying is still bad because you are given bad information
  * Principle of Universality
    1. Formulate a maxim (Subjective principle of action)
        * "It is okay to make false promises to save time"
    2. Universalize
    3. Look for contradiction in conception and contradiction in will
        * Conception - "If i lived in a world where false promises are okay, will everyone still be working towards a means to an end"
        * Will
        * If passes conception, it is a Perfect Duty to NOT do such thing
        * If doesn't pass will, it is Imperfect Duty; You will only do this IF some situtation exists
    * If you took what you did and imagined everyone else did it, would it still be of worth

* A means to an end - Do you actually still respect someone after you do not need them anymore

## Virtue Ethics
* This theory basically is a list of virtues that are considered good. If someone
  were to follow these virtues, they are good people
* What is the Good Life?
* Happiness = Contentment/Satisfaction
* Aristotle's Happiness = Eudaimonia("Flourishing, Well being") - Objective Happiness/Good that is common to all of us
* Eudaimonia = "rational activity of the soul - Aristotle"
    * Cultivating and Practicing our Essential Capacities
    * If happiness == contentment, Abe is happy living in a cave
    * Else, Abe is not happy; Abe is mistaken. He only thinks he is happy
    * Happiness is rational activity of the soul; cultivating and excerisizing essential capacity
* Virtue vs. Happiness
  * Virtue
    * Cannot be only partially virtuous and be happy
    * Must be completely virtuous. Couragous and Honest means you are happy.
    * This is a `AND` type of question. Not an `OR`
  * Happiness/Eudaimonia
    * Material Wealth
    * Relationships
* Virtue is a golden mean between two extreams
