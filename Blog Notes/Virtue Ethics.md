# Lecture 6 - Intrisic Respect

* Who/What a person is
* Tells us who/what category imperative applies to
* Tells us who CI implies to

    * Rationality & Autonomy - lying is still bad because you are given bad information
  * Principle of Universality
    1. Formulate a maxim (Subjective principle of action)
        * "It is okay to make false promises to save time"
    2. Universalize
    3. Look for contradiction in conception and contradiction in will
        * Conception - "If i lived in a world where false promises are okay, will everyone still be working towards a means to an end"
        * Will
        * If passes conception, it is a Perfect Duty to NOT do such thing
        * If doesn't pass will, it is Imperfect Duty; You will only do this IF some situtation exists
    * If you took what you did and imagined everyone else did it, would it still be of worth

* A means to an end - Do you actually still respect someone after you do not need them anymore
